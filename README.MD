# Flask-React Chat Application

This is a simple chat application built with Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. The application allows users to interact with an AI model, manage conversation history, and supports features such as a sidebar for selecting conversations, automated saving of conversations, and handling CORS errors.

## Features

- **Backend:**

  - Flask server with API endpoints for chatting with an AI model.
  - Blueprint structure for organizing routes.
  - CORS handling to allow frontend communication.
  - Conversation management (saving, deleting) with JSON storage.

- **Frontend:**
  - React app with a chat interface using Bootstrap.
  - Sidebar for selecting conversations, which can be hidden.
  - Messages are displayed with rich formatting (bold, headings, code blocks).
  - Automated saving of conversations without a manual save button.
  - PWA support for offline capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-react-chat-app.git
   cd flask-react-chat-app
````

2. **Setup the backend:**

   Navigate to the `back/` directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd back/
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup the frontend:**

   Navigate to the `front/` directory and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../front/
   npm install
   ```

4. **Running the application:**

   In the project root directory, run the following command to start both the Flask server and the React app:

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

   - The Flask server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
   - The React app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.

## Usage

- **Chat Interface:** Type messages in the chat box, and the AI model will respond. Conversations are saved automatically.
- **Sidebar:** Use the sidebar to switch between conversations. You can delete a conversation using the trash icon. The sidebar can be hidden using the hamburger menu.
- **Rich Text Support:** Messages can include bold text, headings, and code blocks.

## Troubleshooting

- **CORS Issues:** Ensure that the backend has CORS configured correctly. If you encounter a CORS error, try clearing your browser cache or ensure the server allows requests from your frontend origin.
- **502 Error:** If you encounter a 502 error when making requests to the AI model, ensure that the external API is reachable and that your request format matches the expected structure.
